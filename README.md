**<============ Precursor ============>**

Exert is my own X11 (XCB) window manager. All the code is in 1 file, main.cpp and i've annotated it where needs be!

**<============ Features  ============>**
- Automatic Tiling
- Window Resizing
- Window Moving
- Full-screening Windows
- Keybinds
- Monitor & Wallpaper customisation
- So on...

**<============= Warning =============>**

Exert is not intended for anything other than my own personal usage - so much so that the configuration file is integrated into main.cpp! If you're looking for an X11 WM to use this isn't it - choose something like I3 instead as you'd have to fork this repository to customise the configuration to your needs. However, if you're here rather to learn how an X11 WM works, this should help you significantly on your journey, and good luck to making your own! I've made a video on some good resources you can use to help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev5WrkirrxI.

**<============= Future =============>**

As mentioned before, exert is a personal project and therefore development can cease at any time - I only make the features I need! This project is also *eventually* to be superceded by my future wayland wm / compositor, excerp, and obviously when that happens this project will cease to be updated (although will still remain as a learning resource for others).
